1.Write a Python program to input a list of integers. Identify and print all pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to a user-defined target value.

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 6

for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
            print((nums[i], nums[j]))


2.Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student with their name, roll number, and marks. Write a program to display the name of the student with the highest marks

students = [
    {"name": "Amit", "roll": 1, "marks": 78},
    {"name": "Neha", "roll": 2, "marks": 92},
    {"name": "Ravi", "roll": 3, "marks": 85}
]

topper = max(students, key=lambda s: s["marks"])
print("Topper:", topper["name"])


3.Write a program to split a list of integers into two separate lists: 
One containing only even numbers. 
One containing only odd numbers.

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
odd = [x for x in nums if x % 2 != 0]

print("Even:", even)
print("Odd:", odd)


4.Write a Python program to rotate the elements of a list `n` positions to the right.

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n = 2
n = n % len(nums)
rotated = nums[-n:] + nums[:-n]
print(rotated)

5.Write a program to find all subsets of a list

from itertools import combinations

nums = [1, 2, 3]
subsets = []
for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
    subsets += list(combinations(nums, i))
print(subsets)


6.Write a Python program to take a tuple of integers and generate a new tuple containing only the prime numbers.


def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

nums = (10, 15, 3, 7, 20)
primes = tuple(n for n in nums if is_prime(n))
print(primes)


7.Create a tuple containing employee data (ID, Name, Salary, Department). 
Write a program to: - Extract salaries into a separate tuple. - Calculate the average salary.


employees = (
    (1, "Amit", 50000, "HR"),
    (2, "Neha", 60000, "IT"),
    (3, "Raj", 55000, "Sales")
)

salaries = tuple(e[2] for e in employees)
avg = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)
print("Salaries:", salaries)
print("Average Salary:", avg)



8.Write a program to merge two tuples of the same length into a single tuple of paired elements.

a = (1, 2, 3)
b = (4, 5, 6)
merged = tuple(zip(a, b))
print(merged)


9.Write a Python program to sort a tuple of tuples based on the second value in each inner tuple. 

t = ((1, 5), (2, 3), (4, 1))
sorted_t = tuple(sorted(t, key=lambda x: x[1]))
print(sorted_t)


10.Create a tuple of strings. Write a program to find the longest string and its index in the tuple.


words = ("apple", "banana", "grape", "strawberry")
longest = max(words, key=len)
print("Longest:", longest)
