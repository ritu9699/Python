11.Write a program to create a set from a list of integers. Then, identify and display all elements that are repeated in the original list. 

nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
dupes = {n for n in nums if nums.count(n) > 1}
print(dupes)

12.Create two sets, one representing students who play cricket and another representing students who play football. Write a program to display: 
- Students who play both sports. 
- Students who play only one sport.
- Students who play neither sport (use a universal set).


cricket = {"Amit", "Neha", "Ravi"}
football = {"Neha", "Kiran", "Ravi"}
all_students = {"Amit", "Neha", "Ravi", "Kiran", "Suresh"}

print("Both:", cricket & football)
print("Only one:", cricket ^ football)
print("Neither:", all_students - (cricket | football))


13.Create a set of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its square (e.g., `(2, 4)`). Write a program to filter out tuples where the square is even.

pairs = {(x, x**2) for x in range(1, 10)}
filtered = {p for p in pairs if p[1] % 2 != 0}
print(filtered)

14.Write a Python program to compare two sets and identify whether they are equivalent, one is a subset of the other, or if they have any common elements.

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {2, 3, 4}

print("Equivalent:", A == B)
print("A subset of B:", A <= B)
print("Common:", A & B)

15.Write a Python program to create a nested dictionary representing a library system. Each key is a genre, and its value is another dictionary containing book titles and their respective authors. Display all books of a specific genre entered by the user.


library = {
    "Fiction": {"1984": "George Orwell", "The Alchemist": "Paulo Coelho"},
    "Science": {"A Brief History of Time": "Stephen Hawking"}
}

genre = input("Enter genre: ")
if genre in library:
    for book, author in library[genre].items():
        print(book, "by", author)
else:
    print("Genre not found")


16.Create a dictionary with product names as keys and their prices as values. Write a program to:
Find the product with the highest price.
Apply a discount of 10% to all prices and display the updated dictionary


products = {"Laptop": 70000, "Phone": 50000, "Tablet": 30000}
max_product = max(products, key=products.get)
print("Costliest:", max_product)
discounted = {k: v*0.9 for k, v in products.items()}
print("After 10% discount:", discounted)


17.Write a program to merge two dictionaries where the keys are the same but the values are lists. 
Combine the lists of values for duplicate keys.
Example: Input: {'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3]} and {'a': [4], 'c': [5]}, Output: {'a': [1, 2, 4], 'b': [3], 'c': [5]}


d1 = {'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3]}
d2 = {'a': [4], 'c': [5]}
merged = d1.copy()
for k, v in d2.items():
    merged[k] = merged.get(k, []) + v
print(merged)


18.Create a dictionary of student records where each key is a roll number and the value is another dictionary containing name, marks, and attendance. Write a program to: 
- Find students with attendance below 75%. 
- Calculate the average marks of all students.


students = {
    1: {"name": "Amit", "marks": 80, "attendance": 85},
    2: {"name": "Neha", "marks": 70, "attendance": 65},
    3: {"name": "Ravi", "marks": 90, "attendance": 95}
}

low_att = [s["name"] for s in students.values() if s["attendance"] < 75]
avg = sum(s["marks"] for s in students.values()) / len(students)
print("Low attendance:", low_att)
print("Average marks:", avg)


19.Write a Python program to group anagrams from a list of strings into a dictionary where the keys are sorted versions of the words, and the values are lists of anagrams. 
Example: Input: `['listen', 'silent', 'enlist', 'hello', 'ohell']`, 
Output: `{'eilnst': ['listen', 'silent', 'enlist'], 'ehllo': ['hello', 'ohell']}


words = ['listen', 'silent', 'enlist', 'hello', 'ohell']
anagrams = {}
for w in words:
    key = ''.join(sorted(w))
    anagrams.setdefault(key, []).append(w)
print(anagrams)


20.Write a program to split a list of integers into two separate lists: - One containing only even numbers. - One containing only odd numbers.


nums = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
even = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
odd = [x for x in nums if x % 2 != 0]
print("Even:", even)
print("Odd:", odd)
